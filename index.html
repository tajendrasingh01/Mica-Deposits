                <p>Micas are a group of minerals whose outstanding physical characteristic is that individual mica crystals can easily be  split into extremely thin elastic plates.This characteristic is described as perfect basal cleavage. </p>
                        <h2> <br> Origin </b></h2>
                        <p> <br> Micas may originate as the result of diverse processes under several different conditions,include crystallization from consolidating magmas, deposition by fluids derived from or directly associated with magmatic activities, deposition by fluids circulating during both contact and regional metamorphism, and formation as the result of alteration processes—perhaps even those caused by weathering—that involve minerals such as feldspars.</p>

                        <p class ="services__description" > It can be found on seafloors where clastic sedimentation, which results from the relocation of minerals and organic matter to sites other than their places of origin, is lacking or nearly so. Although some glauconite has been interpreted to have been formed from preexisting layered silicates (e.g., detrital biotite), most of it appears to have crystallized from aluminosilicate gels—perhaps under the influence of biochemical activities that produce reducing environments.</p>

It alters rather easily during chemical weathering and thus is rare in sediments and sedimentary rocks.</p>

                        <p class="services__description">Is rare in igneous rocks; it does, however, occur in some ultramafic (silica-poor) rocks. For example, it occurs in some peridotites, especially those called kimberlites, which are the rocks in which diamonds occur. Phlogopite also is a rare constituent of some magnesium-rich pegmatites. Its most common occurrence, however, is in impure limestones that have undergone contact metasomatism, a process through which the chemical composition of rocks is changed.

In fine-grained foliated rocks, such as phyllites, the muscovite occurs as microscopic grains (sericite) that give these rocks their silky lustres. It also occurs in some granitic rocks and is common in complex granitic pegmatites and within miarolitic druses, which are late-magmatic, crystal-lined cavities in igneous rocks. </p>

                         <p> <br>Mica or “vermiculite” is a mineral formed out of a chemical reaction between quartz and granite. Exposed to extreme heat, the mineral expands into worm-like pieces 2000 or even 3000 % of their original size, in a spectrum of brilliant colours. The characteristics of this mineral have been known in Japan for 6 centuries. Mica is also known as “strange stone”, “breathing stone” or “miracle stone”. After the mica has been heat-expanded, it is crushed into small pieces and stuck on a non-woven backing. Finally, the surface is coloured. <br></p>
